## Mathew Blanco

I am currently a senior at Queens College pursuing my Bachelor’s in
Computer Science.  I am lucky to have had family and friends who have
given me courage when I thought I had none.  Simply not wanting to
disappoint those close to me or myself has increased my motivation and,
consequently, my own confidence.  This has developed into a will to keep
fighting and always trying my hardest to accomplish any task at hand.

Because I have been so lucky to have this network, I understand the
value of community and teamwork.  The community as much as my academic
goals have been the focus of my work.  Service has
been at the heart of what I do for the better part of my High School
and Collegiate years.  My volunteer experience includes afterschool
child care and tutoring in the Hell’s Kitchen community.  I
spent three hours a day with children who would otherwise have had
nowhere to go after school, allowing them to study, do homework, and
have a safe place within the community they could come together to be
children for a few hours a night.  

I also participated in Habitat for Humanity service trips.  I was and
have been a huge proponent of the work done by Habitat for Humanity.
Over the course of two service trips, I spent two weeks in Bayou La
Batre, Alabama restoring the home of a family devastated by Hurricane
Katrina and two weeks in the Appalachia Region of Tennessee
constructing a new home for a family who never never had the means to
own one before.  The time spent in these communities and with those on
these trips has given me the empathic foundation with which I live my
life everyday.  Along with my volunteer service I spent time
collecting and fundraising for the Atlanta Community Food Bank to
support the less fortunate in the community.

I am an Applied Mathematics Student with a concentration in Computer
Science at Queens College. In my free time I study data analytics,
number theory, and video game design. At the Queens College incubator,
my principal focus is on the STEM+C project. I hope to help improve
learning in the fields related to STEM+C and to help students from
various backgrounds succeed in fields that are so important.

## Kevin Ramsunder

My name is Kevin Ramsunder, and I am a third year undergraduate
student at Queens College. I started programming as a hobby in high
school after participating in my school's robotics program. Nowadays,
my main goal in this field is to use technology to improve every
aspect of our daily lives. Aside from my own personal projects, I
enjoy coding collaboratively with others who share the same passion
for creating useful and innovative software. I am also a believer in
the Open-Source Movement and its mission to make software free for the
community. At the Queens College Incubator, I am interested in the
Starter Jobs task in hopes that the project will have a real world
impact for people who are having trouble finding jobs. My resume is 
available here. My website is KevinRamsunder.com.

## Miriam Striks

I am a senior majoring in computer science at Queens College, where I
also work with Professor Christopher Hanusa doing research in
experimental mathematics. As part of our research, I recently
developed a program that yields meaningful data for combinatorics
research. I have previously worked at Tax Credit Co., a tax credit
consultancy based in Los Angeles, where I created an internal credit
tracking template that resulted in enhanced credit management for
Fortune 500 clients. I look forward to contributing to projects at the
Queens College incubator, particularly the Starter Jobs project.

## Aryan Jabbari

I am a graduate student at CUNY Queens College and an IT aide at Queens College's Academic Advising Center.  In addition to learning at Queens College, I am an active student at Coursera and regularly take computer science courses online.  I am interested in using technology to help others, especially those in Queens county.  My principal focuses at the Queens College technology incubator is on the Starter Jobs and Flushing Chamber of Commerce projects.
