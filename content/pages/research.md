# Building performance

In partnership with the building performance lab at the CUNY School of Professional Studies 
and the CUNY Instituute of Software Design and Development the Queens Incubator is 
applying machine learning to the prediction of tempratures and energy consumption of 
large buildings.  Every year, New York City Government (and its residents) spend literally 
billions of dollars to heat and cool their living and work space. Sadly much of that spending
is wasteful with buildings being heated and cooled at the same time.  Our project hopes to 
guide New York City agencies on how to make their workspace more comfortable in an energy 
efficient manner.
